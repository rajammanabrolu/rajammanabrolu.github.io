**Prithviraj's Home** Score: 0

>Welcome. You have arrived at the home of the Earth King (a.k.a. Prithviraj in Sanskrit). You see a plaque with an inscription below a picture of him at the door. What do you do?

\>examine plaque

It reads:

"Well, hello there. I'm a researcher on the [Mosaic](https://mosaic.allenai.org/) team in the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/). I received my PhD in Computer Science from the School of Interactive Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Professor Mark Riedl as a research assistant at the [Entertainment Intelligence Lab](https://eilab.gatech.edu/).

I am motivated by the question of how to imbue learning agents with the ability to understand and generate contextually relevant natural language in service of achieving a goal. I focus on two key components in creating such agents: interactivity and environment grounding, shown to be vital parts of language learning in humans. This work lies primarily at the intersection of **Machine Learning**, especially **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Natural Language Processing**. The core theme of my research involves creating **trustworthy and responsible language-based AI agents** that are able to: (1) interactively gather and **align to human preferences via feedback**; and (2) build and use **neurosymbolic world models** that guide the agent's actions in **grounded environments**.

>Your score has gone up by 10 points. You open the door and proceed into the house.
