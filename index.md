**Prithviraj's Home** Score: 0

>Welcome. You have arrived at the home of the Earth King (a.k.a. Prithviraj in Sanskrit). You see a plaque with an inscription below a picture of him at the door. What do you do?

\>examine plaque

It reads:

"Well, hello there. I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego - leading the [ðŸ§‹**PEARLS Lab**ðŸ§‹](http://pearls.ucsd.edu) in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE).
I am recruiting *not* recruiting any students for my lab. More info can be found on my group website.

I'm also a research scientist at [Mosaic AI](https://www.mosaicml.com/) in [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/). My team is recruiting research scientists and engineers with strong RL/distributed systems experience. Please [apply](https://www.databricks.com/company/careers/engineering/genai-research-scientist-7011271002) and drop a note to the right email.

I was previously on the [Mosaic](https://mosaic.allenai.org/) team in the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/). 
I received my PhD in Computer Science from the School of Interactive Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Professor Mark Riedl as a research assistant at the [Entertainment Intelligence Lab](https://eilab.gatech.edu/).

My CV is found [here](https://prithvirajva.com/CV.html), my list of publication [here](https://prithvirajva.com/publications.html), and projects [here](https://prithvirajva.com/projects.html).

I am motivated by the question of how to imbue learning agents with the ability to understand and generate contextually relevant natural language in service of achieving a goal. This work lies primarily at the intersection of **Machine Learning**, especially **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Natural Language Processing**. The core theme of my research involves creating **trustworthy and responsible language-based AI agents** that are able to: (1) interactively gather and **align to human preferences via feedback**; and (2) build and use **neurosymbolic world models** that guide the agent's actions in **grounded environments**.
