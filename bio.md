I am originally from Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, India. Since then, I've moved around quite a bit. I've lived in Singapore, Hong Kong, New Jersey, California, and multiple places in India such as Chennai, Hyderabad, and Bangalore.

I've previously worked with the ParlAI team at Facebook AI Research, hosted by Jason Weston, working on situated dialogue and text games in LIGHT. Last year, I was with the Reinforcement Learning team at Microsoft Research Redmond, hosted by Matthew Hausknecht, and worked on using deep reinforcement learning and knowledge graphs to play text-adventure games. I have worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Oracle Intelligent Bots, where I developed a patent pending algorithm to generate noisy knowledge graphs for low resource natural language datasets and a method to use them to improve the natural language understanding capabilities of the chatbot platform. I have previously worked as a Machine Learning Intern at Radix Health, developing and deploying products such as no-show risk models and chatbots that help clinics manage their schedules more efficiently in addition to improving patient access.

My hobbies include Tae Kwon Do, camping/hiking, reading, and gaming. I am a 1st Dan black belt in Tae Kwon Do. In my leftover spare time, I go out into nature, read sci-fi and high fantasy novels, and play MMORPGs.
