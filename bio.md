(for a more "professional bio" see the Home tab - Tl;Dr I'm a postdoctoral researcher interested in interactive, grounded language learning (NLP + RL specifically) at AI2 and got my PhD from Georgia Tech.)

I am originally from Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, India. Since then, I've moved around quite a bit. I've lived in: east/south Asian places like Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo; middle east in Dubai; random American places like New Jersey, California, Indiana, Texas, and Georgia; and multiple places in India such as Chennai, Hyderabad, and Bangalore. I'm currently in Seattle and finding it a bit too rainy for my taste (but hey the boba tea is good).

In the wee few hours that I get when I'm not building RL agents, I try to juggle hobby things, with varying degress of success.

My hobbies include Tae Kwon Do, camping/hiking, reading, acting, writing, gaming, and also getting boba. I am a 1st Dan black belt in WT Tae Kwon Do (and have recently started on other styles!). For naturey things I mostly like solo camping/hiking in not cold climates. I read sci-fi and high fantasy novels (Malazan, Hyperion, you name it), and play MMORPGs/IFs (not much these days though - being a game researcher means you don't actually get to play games (〒^〒)). I do write stories for interactive fiction games and scripts for theatre plays though (used to be an actor but that was too much effort) under a not so psuedo psuedonym. If you bought an itch.io bundle recentlyish, you prob have some of my work. 

I also get a lot of bubble tea (aka boba) with other boba humans, have a tier list of tea places for most cities I've lived in, and my long term life goal is to own a bubble tea shop with an apartment above it so ...
