I am originally from Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, India. Since then, I've moved around quite a bit. I've lived in east/south Asian places like Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, as well as New Jersey, California, Indiana, Georgia and multiple places in India such as Chennai, Hyderabad, and Bangalore. I'm currently in Seattle and finding it a bit too rainy for my taste (but hey the boba is good).

In the wee few hours that I get when I'm not building RL agents, I try to do hobby things, with varying degress of success.

My hobbies include Tae Kwon Do, camping/hiking, reading, gaming, and also getting boba. I am a 1st Dan black belt in Tae Kwon Do. For naturey things I mostly like solo camping/hiking in not cold climates. I read sci-fi and high fantasy novels (Malazan, Hyperion, you name it), and play MMORPGs/IFs (not much these days though - being a game researcher means you don't actually get to play games too much (〒^〒)). I also get a lot of boba with other boba humans and have a tier list of boba places so ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ GIVE BOBA RECS ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ.
